# InsightPDF

**InsightPDF** is an innovative application designed to import documents (HTML, PDF, etc.), extract data, and enable interactive questioning based on the document's content using Large Language Models (LLM) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The project focuses on robust data extraction, parsing, and vectorization of various content types, such as text, tables, and images/graphs, with a specialized approach for each.

## Objective

The primary goal of InsightPDF is to build a system that can interpret and interact with documents. It extracts data from different types of content, processes them, and stores them in a way that enables effective and meaningful interactions via question-answering mechanisms.

## Features

- Import documents (PDF, HTML, etc.)
- Extract and parse text, tables, and images/graphs
- Vectorize extracted content with tailored pipelines
- Store vectors in a searchable vector database
- Provide interactive querying capabilities using LLM and RAG
- Suggestions and follow-ups based on previous queries

## Architecture

InsightPDF's architecture is modular and consists of the following key components:

1. **Document Importer**: Handles the import of documents in various formats.
2. **Data Extractor**: Extracts different types of data (text, tables, images).
3. **Parser**: Parses the extracted data for further processing.
4. **Vectorizer**: Vectorizes each content type with specific pipelines.
5. **Database**: Stores the vectors for efficient retrieval and querying.
6. **RAG Module**: Handles interactive question-answering using vectors and LLM.
7. **Feedback and Improvement Module**: Suggests improvements and follow-ups.

## Content Extraction and Processing

### 1. Text
- **Extraction**: Extracts text based on document structure.
- **Chunking**: Text is chunked based on heading levels, sections, or other logical divisions.
- **Parsing**: Keeps structural information during vectorization.

### 2. Tables
- **Extraction**: Identifies and extracts tabular data.
- **Parsing**: Parses tables into structured formats for vectorization.
- **Vectorization**: Converts parsed tables into vectors.

### 3. Images/Graphs
- **Extraction**: Extracts images and graphs from the document.
- **Interpretation**: Uses LLMs to interpret visual data.
- **Vectorization**: Converts interpreted data into vectors.

## Vectorization Pipeline

- **Text Vectorization**: Utilizes LLM to embed textual content, preserving structural information.
- **Table Vectorization**: Converts tabular data into a format that can be effectively vectorized.
- **Image Vectorization**: Processes images through interpretation and vectorization steps, allowing for rich semantic representation.

## Database Storage

- **Vector Database**: All content vectors are stored in a dedicated database for fast retrieval.
- **Indexed Storage**: Vectors are indexed to facilitate efficient search during query time.

## Interactive Querying with RAG

- **Query Handling**: Users can ask questions based on the content of the document.
- **RAG Process**: Combines LLM capabilities with retrieved vectors to generate relevant responses.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Integrates user feedback for improved suggestions and follow-ups.

## Future Improvements

- Enhanced vectorization techniques for improved accuracy.
- Expanded document format support.
- Better handling of complex tables and multimedia.
- Integration with other knowledge bases for richer contextual understanding.

## Installation

To install and set up the project, follow these steps:
